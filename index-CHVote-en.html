                <h2>CHVote : a public system, Swiss and open source</h2>
                <p>The electronic voting system CHVote is a concrete answer and a real breakthrough in digital technology and
                    e-government.</p>
                <p>This system is the fruit of a <em>partnership</em> between the State Chancellery and the General Directorate of
                    Information
                    Systems (DGSI) of the Department of Security and Economy (DSE) of the Geneva Canton.</p>
                <p>The State of Geneva is pioneering in the e-voting domain with over <em>100 polls</em> successfully accomplished since
                    2003.
                </p>
                <p>CHVote, entirely developed, hosted and exploited by the Canton is today one of only two accredited systems by the Federal
                    Council in Switzerland. It is offered to nearly <em>125’000 voters in 4 cantons</em> (Geneva, Bern, Lucerne and Basel),
                    as
                    much for voting as for electing at the communal, cantonal and federal levels. It also allows people with disabilities to
                    participate in the polls.</p>

                <h2>Transparency and security, a priority</h2>
                <p>On August 19th 2015, the State Council has forwarded to the Grand Council a bill aiming at increasing transparency,
                    allowing
                    the publication of the source code of the e-voting system on the Internet.</p>
                <p>The State of Geneva wishes to <em>increase electorate confidence</em> in a <em>transparent and secure system</em>. In
                    effect,
                    the importance of maximum transparency in matters of political law and e-voting is a priority for the Geneva Canton.</p>
                <p>Since March 8th 2015, CHVote has become a so-called <em>second generation</em> >system with security requirements laid
                    down
                    by the Swiss Confederation (individual verifiability).</p>

                <h2>Open Source license: Affero GPL</h2>
                <p>On July 27th 2016, the State Council has chosen to uphold the Affero GPL open source license for source code publication,
                    the
                    most up to standards in the field. This license has been written by the Free Software Foundation, a token of <em>ethical
                        accuracy</em> and <em>international renown</em>.</p>
                <p>The State of Geneva encourages programmer communities to contribute to source code quality.</p>
