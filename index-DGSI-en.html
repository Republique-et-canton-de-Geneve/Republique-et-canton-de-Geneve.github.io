            <h2>« Open Source » publication of software developed by the State of Geneva</h2>
            <p>
				For a number of years, the Cantonal Administration has been using a range of open source software such as Linux, Drupal, 
				MySql, Apache Tomcat and HTTP Server. The State of Geneva, however, wishes to broaden its  role to become a real player 
				in this field; <em>giving free access to the source codes</em> of the software it develops for its own needs.
            </p>
            <p>
				The State of Geneva aims at <em>promoting its capacity to innovate</em>, principally targeting other public domains whilst also 
				benefitting from developer communities wishing to contribute to the evolution of its software.
            </p>
            <p>
				Furthermore, the publishing of software source codes used by the public administration allows <em>total transparency</em> to be 
				achieved by completely unveiling the building process of coding. The developing community will not fail to point out 
				weaknesses, identifying errors that will then be corrected as a result.                
            </p>
            <p>
				This “unveiling” of software does not constitute a marketing element but rather a <em>cultural change</em> amidst the Cantonal 
				Administration. By proceeding as such, the State accepts it will be placed under scrutiny and may risk negative 
				repercussions to its image. In summary, the functionality and security of Geneva State’s software may only benefit from 
				this change; with flaws being detected that may not have surfaced during testing carried out solely by the Cantonal Administration.
            </p>
            <p>
				This would not involve inventing a new publishing model of “open source”, belonging to Geneva’s administration’s, 
				but rather rely on the most commonly used web service, GitHub, in order to publish its new developments; 
				presuming the State of Geneva owns the rights to do so after a full assessment regarding State security. 
				In addition, the free general public license, <em>GNU Affero (AGPL)</em>, have been chosen to publish the source codes. 
            </p>
            <p>
				The Affero GPL license has been chosen for this purpose as it does not allow external users to re-privatize the code 
				and has also been designed for the internet environment. The software was written by the Free Software Foundation, 
				an internationally renowned and ethical organization.
