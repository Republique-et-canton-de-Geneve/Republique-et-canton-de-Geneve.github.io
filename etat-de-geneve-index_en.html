					<p class="Paragraphe-standard ParaOverride-2"><span class="CharOverride-3">« Open Source » publication of software developed by the State of Geneva</span></p>
					<p class="Paragraphe-standard ParaOverride-2"><span class="CharOverride-4">Since quite a few years the Cantonal Administration has been using a wide range of open source software, such as Linux, Drupal, MySql, as well as Apache Tomcat and HTTP Server, to name a few. The State of Geneva, however, wishes to broaden its role of mere user and become a real actor in this field </span><span class="CharOverride-5">by giving free access to the source code </span><span class="CharOverride-4">of the software it develops for its own needs. </span></p>
					<p class="Paragraphe-standard ParaOverride-2"><span class="CharOverride-4">The State of Geneva aims </span><span class="CharOverride-5">at diffusing and promoting its capacity to innovate</span><span class="CharOverride-4">, mainly targeting other public domains, while benefitting from developer communities wishing to contribute to the evolution of its software. </span></p>
					<p class="Paragraphe-standard ParaOverride-2"><span class="CharOverride-4">On the other hand, the publication of source code from software used by the public administration has </span><span class="CharOverride-5">a double value of transparency</span><span class="CharOverride-4">, since it unveils completely the underlying coding secrets and because the programmer communities will not fail to point out weaknesses in the code, as well as the failings that they will discover, which will then be necessary to correct, in accordance with the implied risks. </span></p>
					<p class="Paragraphe-standard ParaOverride-2"><span class="CharOverride-4">This “unveiling” of software does not constitute a marketing element but rather </span><span class="CharOverride-5">a cultural change</span><span class="CharOverride-4"> amidst the cantonal administration, because by proceeding as such, the State accepts being placed under the scrutiny of all and exposes its image to some risks. In return, Geneva State’s software can only be improved this way, both on the aspect of its functionalities as with its security, by detecting flaws that wouldn’t necessarily have surfaced during testing under the exclusive supervision of the cantonal administration.</span></p>
					<p class="Paragraphe-standard ParaOverride-2"><span class="CharOverride-4">This isn’t a matter of inventing a new “open source” publication model proper to Geneva’s administration, but rather to rely upon the web service used by the greater number, which is GitHub, in order to publish its new developments with it, as long as the State of Geneva has the right to do it and after full assessment of the risks to State security. One final clarification, it has decided to publish its source code under the free general public license </span><span class="CharOverride-5">GNU Affero</span><span class="CharOverride-4"> (AGPL).</span></p>
					<p class="Paragraphe-standard ParaOverride-2"><span class="CharOverride-4">The Affero GPL license has been chosen because it is designed for the internet and does not allow private actors to privatize the code again; it is also written by the Free Software Foundation, which is a token of ethical accuracy and international renown.</span></p>
